## How Many Cancers Did Chernobyl Really Cause?
### A. PROSPECTUS
Thirty four years have passed since the worst nuclear reactor accident in the world occurred at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on 26 April 1986
in Ukraine. The radioactive contamination which resulted from the explosion and fire in the first few days spread over large areas of neighbouring 
Belarus and the Russian Federation, with most of the fallout in Belarus. While national and local authorities did not immediately disclose 
the scale of the accident, the mitigation measures, such as distribution of potassium iodine pills, food restriction, and mass evacuation
from areas where the radioactive contamination was greatest, undoubtedly reduced the health impact of the radiation exposure and saved many lives.

Epidemiological studies that have investigated the link between the Chernobyl accident and cancer have largely focused on malignant diseases in children, specifically thyroid cancer and leukaemia. There is good evidence to suggest that rates of thyroid cancer in children from the countries that were formally part of the Soviet Union have risen as a consequence of the Chernobyl accident. 

> "A quarter of all thyroid cancer cases among patients who were children at the time of the Chernobyl accident, are “probably” 
due to high doses of radiation received during and after the event, [**the United Nations body reviewing the effects of atomic radiation on human 
health and the environment**](https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/04/1008292) has said.

### C. EXPLORING DATA
A compilation of incidence rates of thyroid cancer between 1982 and 2015 among those exposed under the age of 18 in Belarus, the Russian Federation (the Bryansk, Kaluga, Orel and
Tula oblasts) and Ukraine is presented. The total number of cases basically increased monotonically during the last decade (2006–2015). The total number of cases of
thyroid cancer registered in the period 1991–2015 in males and females who were under 18 in 1986, for the whole of Belarus and Ukraine and for the four most
contaminated regions of the Russian Federation, exceeded 19,000.
