## A. PROSPECTUS
Thirty four years have passed since the worst nuclear reactor accident in the world occurred at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine. 
The radioactive contamination which resulted from the explosion and fire in the first few days spread over large areas of neighbouring 
Belarus and the Russian Federation, with most of the fallout in Belarus. While national and local authorities did not immediately disclose 
the scale of the accident, the mitigation measures, such as distribution of potassium iodine pills, food restriction, and mass evacuation
from areas where the radioactive contamination was greatest, undoubtedly reduced the health impact of the radiation exposure and saved many lives.

due to high doses of radiation received during and after the event, [**the United Nations body reviewing the effects of atomic radiation on human 
health and the environment**](https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/04/1008292) has said.





Cancer is a large group of diseases that can start in almost any organ or tissue of the body when abnormal cells grow uncontrollably, go beyond their usual boundaries to invade adjoining parts of the body and/or spread to other organs. The latter process is called metastasizing and is a major cause of death from cancer. A neoplasm and malignant tumour are other common names for cancer.

Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, accounting for an estimated 9.6 million deaths, or one in six deaths (2018). Lung, prostate, colorectal, stomach and liver cancer are the most common types of cancer in men, while breast, colorectal, lung, cervical and thyroid cancer are the most common among women.
