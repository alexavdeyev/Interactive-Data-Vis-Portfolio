          The past few years have been marked by the incredible growth and popularity of social networking
          sites (SNSs), such as Instagram and Facebook. Social networking sites enable users to create public, 
          or semi-public, profiles, and to connect that profile to others to form
          a personal network. The access to these platforms via ubiquitous technologies has enabled people
          to document nearly every aspect of their everyday lives, to present themselves and manage their social
          relationships online, to communicate with friends who are part of their social network and, from every
          part of the world, to be always updated on what is happening, to interact with other cultures without
          time limits, to access health-promoting information and, also, to facilitate scholastic research and
          study. Furthermore, the immediate, low cost, private, and hidden communication provided
          by social networks has helped to make SNSs a common online destination for adolescents.
          People who connect the most are the so-called “iGeneration” or iGen, the post-Millennial generation
          who were born after 1995, and who have grown up using mobile devices, social media, and constant
          connectivity <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/19/6952">(Cipolletta S., 2020)</a>.<br>

          <h2>Most popular social media of teenagers in the United States</h2>
          <p>This statistic gives information on the most popular social media sites used by teenage and young adult 
             internet users in the United States as of the third quarter of 2020. During the survey period, it was found that 63 percent of 
             responding internet users aged 15 to 25 years used social photo sharing app Instagram. Despite Snapchat's dominance, Facebook 
             continues to be the more widely used social networking site used by teenagers and young adults. A total of 50 percent of 
             respondents currently use Facebook, compared to 48 percent of respondents who stated that they used Snapchat. 
             Yet when teens, whose average age was 16, rated their most important social network, Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter where 
             given more important ratings than Facebook. These social networks are being increasingly visited via mobile devices.<br><br>

          <h2>Does Social Media Cause Depression?</h2>
          <p>Is using social media making our kids unhappy? Evidence is mounting that there is a link between social media and 
            <a href="https://childmind.org/topics/concerns/depression/">depression.</a> In several recent studies, 
            <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2167702617723376">teenage</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26783723">young adult</a> 
            users who spend the most time on Instagram, Facebook and other platforms were shown to have a substantially (from 13 to 66 percent) higher rate of reported 
            depression than those who spent the least time.<br>
            Does that mean that Instagram and Facebook are actually causing depression? These studies show a correlation, not causation. But it’s worth a 
            serious look at how social media <a href="https://childmind.org/article/how-using-social-media-affects-teenagers/">could be affecting teenagers and young adults</a> 
            negatively.
          </p>
          <p>The share of U.S. teenagers who have experienced at least one major depressive episode in the past year rose to 14.4 percent in 2018,
             according to <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/cbhsq-reports/NSDUHNationalFindingsReport2018/NSDUHNationalFindingsReport2018.pdf">
             an annual survey by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration</a>. That is almost double the 2006 rate of 7.9 percent.<be>
             Meanwhile, the share of 12 to 17-year-olds receiving treatment for these episodes has not increased majorly over the past years and has instead stagnated 
             around 40 percent of those affected. The rate was slightly higher at around 45 percent for those experiencing one or more depressive episodes with severe impairment.

          <h2>Teens have mixed views on the impact of social media on their lives</h2>
          <p>These are some of the key findings from the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/05/31/teens-social-media-technology-2018/">Pew Research Center's</a>
             surveys of 743 teens living in the U.S. conducted March 7 to April 10, 2018. 
          </p>
          <p>Despite the nearly ubiquitous presence of social media in their lives, there is no clear consensus among teens about these platforms’ ultimate impact on 
             people their age. A plurality of teens (45%) believe social media has a neither positive nor negative effect on people their age. Meanwhile, roughly 
             three-in-ten teens (31%) say social media has had a mostly positive impact, while 24% describe its effect as mostly negative.
          </p>
          <p>Given the opportunity to explain their views in their own words, teens who say social media has had a mostly positive effect tended to stress issues 
             related to connectivity and connection with others. Some 40% of these respondents said that social media has had a positive impact because it helps them 
             keep in touch and interact with others. Many of these responses emphasize how social media has made it easier to communicate with family and friends 
             and to connect with new people.
          </p>
          <p>There is slightly less consensus among teens who say social media has had a mostly negative effect on people their age. The top response 
             (mentioned by 27% of these teens) is that social media has led to more bullying and the overall spread of rumors.
          </p>
          <p>Meanwhile, 12% criticize social media for influencing teens to give in to peer pressure, while smaller shares express concerns 
              that these sites could lead to psychological issues or drama.</p>

        <p>Name-calling and rumor-spreading have long been an unpleasant and challenging aspect of adolescent life. But the proliferation

        <h2>Global Views on Cyberbullying</h2>
        <p>One in three parents globally report knowing a child in their community that is the victim of cyberbullying; majorities in every 
           country feel existing anti-bullying measures are insufficient when it comes to handling cyberbullying. 
           <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2018-06/cyberbullying_june2018.pdf">Ipsos’ recent Global Advisor 
           study</a>, carried out in 28 countries, finds that awareness of cyberbullying is increasing globally, up 9 percentage points from 2011.
        </p>
        <p>The study defines cyberbullying as when a child or group of children (under the age of 18) intentionally intimidate, offend, 
           threaten, or embarrass another child or group of children, specifically through the use of information technology, such as a 
           website or chatroom on the Internet, a cellular telephone, or another mobile device. </p>
        <p>Globally, 17% say their own child has experienced cyberbullying. This number is on the rise, namely in South Africa (up from 10% in 
           2011 to 25% now) and Turkey (up from 5% in 2011 to 19% now). The United States has also seen a significant uptick in parents reporting their
           child has been cyberbullied, up to 27% this year from 15% in 2011.</p>
